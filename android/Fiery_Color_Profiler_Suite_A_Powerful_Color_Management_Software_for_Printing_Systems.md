# Fiery Color Profiler Suite: A Powerful Color Management Software for Printing Systems
 
Fiery Color Profiler Suite is a color management software that provides integrated functionality and quality control for printing systems. It allows users to create, edit and maintain color profiles, match color to a reference, and achieve consistent output across multiple printers. Fiery Color Profiler Suite also benefits from EFI's next-generation color profiling technology, Fiery Edge, which delivers improved out-of-the-box color, smoother gradients, reduced image grain and enhanced shadow detail.

Fiery Color Profiler Suite can be purchased as a package that includes the software with a measurement instrument or as a software-only package. The software-only package requires a license activation code and a spectrophotometer serial number. The license activation code is on the license card in the media pack, and the serial number is on the instrument or the instrument cradle. Users can download and activate the license online or offline, depending on their internet connection.
 
Fiery Color Profiler Suite is compatible with Windows 7, 8, 10 and 11 operating systems. It works with Fiery digital front ends to provide optimal color quality for every stage of the printing workflow. Users can download a free demo version of the software from the EFI website[^2^] [^4^], which is fully functional apart from the saving of profiles.

## Fiery Color Profiler Suite Features
 
Fiery Color Profiler Suite offers a comprehensive set of tools for color management and quality control. Some of the main features are:
 
- **Calibration:** Users can create a calibration set for each paper type and press, and easily calibrate their printers using a wizard-driven interface. Calibration ensures that the printer reproduces colors consistently and accurately.
- **Profile creation:** Users can create color profiles for different printing conditions and link them to calibration sets. Profiles define how colors are reproduced on a specific printer and substrate. Fiery Color Profiler Suite supports various types of profiles, such as printer, monitor, scanner, camera, and device link profiles.
- **Profile optimization:** Users can optimize their profiles to achieve better color matching, smoother gradients, reduced image grain, and enhanced shadow detail. Fiery Color Profiler Suite uses Fiery Edge technology to deliver improved out-of-the-box color and advanced profile editing capabilities.
- **Profile verification:** Users can verify that their profiles are achieving the desired results by measuring color patches and comparing them to a reference standard. Fiery Color Profiler Suite provides graphical and numerical feedback on the profile performance and quality.
- **Print workflow:** Users can set up a print workflow to make it easy to use their profiles in different applications. Fiery Color Profiler Suite integrates with Fiery digital front ends and allows users to assign profiles to hot folders, virtual printers, or presets.
- **Spot color matching:** Users can optimize spot colors to achieve precise and consistent color reproduction. Fiery Color Profiler Suite allows users to edit spot color libraries, create custom spot colors, and adjust spot color rendering.
- **Printer matching:** Users can precisely match up to five same-model Fiery-driven printers and ensure shop-wide consistency. Fiery Color Profiler Suite allows users to align the printers' calibration sets and profiles using a master printer as a reference.

Fiery Color Profiler Suite is a powerful and versatile solution for professional color management. It helps users achieve amazing, precise, and consistent color across their printing systems.
