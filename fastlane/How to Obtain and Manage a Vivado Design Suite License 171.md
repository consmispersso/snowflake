## How to Download and Install Vivado Design Suite 171
 
The first step to use Vivado Design Suite 171 is to download and install it on your computer. You can download the installation files from the Xilinx Download Center[^1^]. You can choose between two editions: Vivado ML Standard Edition and Vivado ML Enterprise Edition. The Standard Edition is free and includes the basic features of Vivado Design Suite, such as logic synthesis, implementation, simulation, IP integrator, and device programmer. The Enterprise Edition is paid and includes additional features, such as high-level synthesis, system generator, partial reconfiguration, and advanced verification.
 
To install Vivado Design Suite 171, you need to follow the instructions in the Vivado Design Suite Release Notes, Installation, and Licensing Guide[^1^]. You can choose between a web installer or a full installer. The web installer allows you to download only the components you need, while the full installer downloads all the components at once. You can also choose between a single-file download or a split-file download. The single-file download is faster but requires more disk space, while the split-file download is slower but requires less disk space.
 
After downloading the installation files, you need to run the installer and follow the steps on the screen. You can choose between a typical installation or a custom installation. The typical installation installs the most common components, while the custom installation allows you to select which components you want to install. You can also choose the installation directory and whether to create shortcuts or not.
 
Once the installation is complete, you need to activate your license for Vivado Design Suite 171.
