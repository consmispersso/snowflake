Fontself Maker is an extension for Illustrator and Photoshop CC that lets you create fonts from any vector shapes or bitmap images. You can drag and drop your lettering into the Fontself panel and it will automatically generate a font file that you can install, save or export.

## How to Create a Font with Fontself Maker?
 
Creating a font with Fontself Maker is very easy and fun. Here are the basic steps:
 
1. Create your lettering in Illustrator or Photoshop. You can use any vector shapes or bitmap images as your glyphs. Make sure each glyph is on a separate layer and has a unique name.
2. Select all your glyphs and drag them into the Fontself panel. You will see a preview of your font and some options to adjust it.
3. Give your font a name and choose a font style (regular, bold, italic, etc.). You can also change the font size and color.
4. Add alternates and ligatures if you want. Alternates are different versions of the same glyph that you can access by using OpenType features or keyboard shortcuts. Ligatures are combinations of two or more glyphs that form a single glyph. To add alternates or ligatures, simply drag another glyph on top of an existing one in the Fontself panel and choose the option you want.
5. Adjust the spacing and kerning of your font. Spacing is the horizontal distance between glyphs, while kerning is the adjustment of spacing between specific pairs of glyphs. To adjust the spacing, use the sliders or type values in the Fontself panel. To adjust the kerning, select two glyphs and drag them closer or farther apart in the preview area.
6. Export your font as an OpenType file (.otf). You can choose to export it as a standard font or a color font (if you used color in your glyphs). You can also choose to export it as a web font (.woff) or an SVG font (.svg) for web use.
7. Install your font on your computer by double-clicking on the .otf file and clicking on install. You can also copy it to your fonts folder manually.
8. Enjoy using your font in any application that supports OpenType fonts!

That's it! You have just created your own font with Fontself Maker. You can now use it for any personal or commercial project, as long as you respect the terms of use of Fontself Maker[^4^] [^5^].
